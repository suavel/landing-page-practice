# landing-page-practice

This is a test project for The Odin Project to practice HTML/CSS & proper commits through git.

I am building this page using only HTML & CSS from a provided design of an example page.

Primarily focusing on:
- Practice of git commit timing & message content
- Use of Flexbox
- Build from my current knowledge strictly
- Use only my notes with minimal outside assistance
