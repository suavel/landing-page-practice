# landing-page-practice

This is a test project for The Odin Project to practice HTML/CSS & proper commits through git.

The content is a parody of the software industry with all fictional information.

I am building this page using only HTML & CSS from a provided design of an example page.



Primarily focusing on:

- Practice of git commit timing & message content

- Use of Flexbox

- Build from my current knowledge strictly

- Use only my notes with minimal outside assistance
